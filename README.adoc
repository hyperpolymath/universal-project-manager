= UPM - Universal Project Manager (Archived)

== Status: Superseded

75% complete. 58 blockers. The blockers were the message.

This project has been *archived*. Its purpose has been absorbed by:
- *Conative Gating* - Enforcement
- *STATE.scm* - Per-project checkpoints
- *ECOSYSTEM.scm* - Cross-project coordination
- *policy.ncl* - Single source of truth for rules

== The Lesson

Complex orchestration machinery is a symptom of enforcement failure. When AI assistants actually follow policy, you don't need elaborate systems to manage the chaos they create.

== What This Was

A comprehensive, language-agnostic CI/CD framework that automatically detected project configurations and provided unified scripts for building, testing, and deploying across multiple platforms.

*Features it had:*
- Auto-Detection - Automatically detect languages, package managers, test frameworks
- Multi-Language Support - JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, etc.
- Platform Agnostic - GitHub Actions and GitLab CI
- Mirror Sync - Event-driven repository mirroring
- Unified Scripts - Single set of scripts across CI platforms

== Useful Patterns Preserved

The CI scripts (`ci-scripts/`) contain useful patterns for:
- Project detection (`detect.sh`)
- Multi-language setup (`setup.sh`)
- Platform-agnostic testing (`test.sh`)
- Repository mirroring (`sync-mirror.sh`)

These patterns may be referenced by future projects but are not actively maintained.
